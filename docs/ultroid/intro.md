Ultroid is a pluggable telegram userbot, made in python using Telethon!

# Why Ultroid ?
---
### 1. Built From Scratch

Ultroid has been written from scratch, making it more stable and less of crashes.

### 2. Better Error handling

Error handling been done in the best way possible, such that the bot doesn't crash and stop all of a sudden.

### 3. Lightweight

Ultroid has minimal amount of plugins (just the necessary ones) in the main repository, and all the other less-usefull stuff in the addons repository. This facilitates quick deployments and lag free use.

### 4. Herokusupport 

Unlike many other userbots which are being suspended by heroku, Ultroid doesn't get suspended. 

### 5. Install any plugin

Ultroid can install any plugin from the most of the other 'userbots' without any issue.

### 6. Safety First

Ultroid warns you when you try to install/execute dangerous stuff (people nowadays make plugins to hack user accounts, Ultroid is safe)

### 7. PIP Module Available (soon)

We have managed to pack the core into a pip package, which we'll release soon! This means anyone can make a userbot with just the stuff they like!! (Further info on release)
